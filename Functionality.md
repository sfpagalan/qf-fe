# Explanation of functionality

## StoryProgression.js

- State Management: The component uses states to manage the current story segments, available choices, and the current segment index.

- Story Progression: It displays the story segments and presents choices to the user. Selecting a choice triggers the next part of the story.

- API Calls: It uses Axios to make calls to your backend/OpenAI API to fetch new story segments and choices based on user decisions.

## CreateCharacterScreen.js

- Removed Unused Code: I've removed comments and unused code for clarity and efficiency.

- Simplified createCharacter Call: The createCharacter function is now called with the new character data directly. Make sure your API function is set up to handle this data correctly.

- Styling and Layout: Adjusted styles and layout to make the UI more responsive and visually appealing.

- Error Handling: Added basic error handling for the character creation process.

- Navigation: After successful character creation, the user is navigated to the 'QuestForge' screen with the new character data.
